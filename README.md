I am a Computer Science undergrad at UFPR. My main interests are technology and Data Science, though I like to learn different things such as history, physics and biology. Because of that, I'm really keen on multidisciplinary projects.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some Data Science/Data Analysis projects and you can check them on my Github. For now, I'm using them to practice, so they might be a little basic, but feel free to propose changes. Suggestions are always welcome too :)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Tableau and SQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can! My Python skills are pretty solid, and I'm always willing to learn new languages/technologies!
